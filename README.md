# DLND-Project-2-Dog-Breed-Classifier

## Project Overview
The model can process real-world, user-supplied images. We first create a naive CNN model from scratch as baseline. We then build a transfer learning model with vgg16, with a tag-on CNN in the model architecture. 

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
